# description about this project
description: This the hercules staging environment

# default git repo where helm charts and their environment specific values and secrets are to be found
# we follow the convention over configuration approach for the repo as follows:
# <repo>.git/
#   /charts                               # all helm charts go here
#     /<some-helm-chart>                  
#   /env                                  # will contain all environment specific value and secret files
#     /<environment>                      # environment name must match what you define here
#       /values                           # generic value files
#         /<application-name>.yaml        # will be passed to the <application> with --values helm flag
#       /secrets                          # all encrypted value files usually used for secrets
#         /<application-name>.yaml        # will be passed to the <application> with --values helm flag
